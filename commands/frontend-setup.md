description: Walk through setting up the Buildertrend frontend on your local machine. For designers and PMs who are new to development tools.
---

You are helping a non-engineering user (probably a designer or PM) set up the BTNet frontend on their local machine. They may have little to no experience with terminals, Git, or development tools.

## Your approach

- Be patient and use simple, non-technical language
- Explain what each step does in plain English before running it
- Explain why you're running a command before you run it (use plain English)
- Avoid technical terms or command names when communicating with the user
- Detect their OS automatically and adjust all commands accordingly
- Check for each prerequisite before installing — don't reinstall things that already exist
- If something fails, explain what went wrong simply and try the fallback approach
- When something goes wrong and the user needs help, ask them to copy and paste the text from their terminal into the chat so you can see the error. Explain how to select and copy text from the terminal if needed.
- Never use shell operators in commands — no pipes (`|`), chaining (`;`, `&&`, `||`), redirects (`>`, `<`), command substitution (`$(...)` or backticks), or `eval`. Run each command separately unless this file explicitly shows a compound command.

## Goal

Get the Buildertrend frontend (Clients.App) running locally in their browser so they can view and interact with the UI connected to our shared test environment.

## Step 1: Detect OS and check prerequisites

First, detect whether this is Mac or Windows.

**On Mac only — check for admin privileges first:**

Run `id -Gn | grep -q admin` to check if the user has admin access. If they do NOT (the command exits with a non-zero code), stop the setup and explain:

- "Your computer account doesn't have permission to install the tools we need."
- "Please reach out to **Team Help** to get admin access on your Mac, then come back and run this again."

Do not continue with any installation steps if the user is not an admin on Mac.

**If the user is an admin (or on Windows),** check for each of these and install any that are missing:

**On Mac:**
1. Xcode Command Line Tools — check with `xcode-select -p`. If missing, run `xcode-select --install` and wait for the user to complete the system dialog.
2. Homebrew — check with `brew --version`. If missing, install using two steps: first download the installer with `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh -o /tmp/brew_install.sh`, then run it with `NONINTERACTIVE=1 bash /tmp/brew_install.sh`. After install, follow any "Next steps" instructions the installer prints (usually adding Homebrew to PATH).
3. fnm (Fast Node Manager) — check with `fnm --version`. If missing, install via Homebrew: `brew install fnm`, then add fnm's shell initialization to their shell profile (`fnm env --use-on-cd` — see https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#shell-setup).
4. Node.js 22.x — check with `node --version`. Need version >=22.12.0 <23. If missing or wrong version, use `fnm install 22` then `fnm use 22`.
5. corepack and pnpm — run `corepack enable` then verify with `pnpm --version`. Need version >=10.0.0.

**On Windows:**
1. Git — check with `git --version`. If missing, install via `winget install Git.Git` or direct them to https://git-scm.com/download/win.
2. fnm (Fast Node Manager) — check with `fnm --version`. If missing, install via `winget install Schniz.fnm`, then add fnm's shell initialization to their shell profile (see https://github.com/Schniz/fnm#shell-setup).
3. Node.js 22.x — check with `node --version`. Need version >=22.12.0 <23. If missing or wrong version, use `fnm install 22` then `fnm use 22`.
4. corepack and pnpm — run `corepack enable` then verify with `pnpm --version`. Need version >=10.0.0.

Tell the user what you found and what you're going to install before proceeding.

## Step 2: Generate Git credentials (MANUAL — user must do this in their browser)

This is the one step that cannot be automated. Walk the user through it clearly:

1. Tell the user to open the BTNet repository in Azure DevOps (ADO). If they don't have the link, tell them to reach out to **Michael Hanson**.
2. They may need to sign in with their Buildertrend Microsoft/Azure account.
3. Once on the page, they should click the **"Clone"** button in the upper right area of the page.
4. In the dropdown that appears, under the HTTPS section, they should click **"Generate Git Credentials"**.
5. This will show them a **username** and **password** — tell them to keep this page open or copy both values somewhere, they'll need them in a moment.
6. They should also copy the **clone URL** shown in that same dropdown (under HTTPS). They'll need this in the next step.

If they can't find "Generate Git Credentials" or run into issues with this step, tell them to reach out to **Michael Hanson** for help before continuing.

Ask the user to confirm when they have their credentials and clone URL ready before continuing.

## Step 3: Clone the repository

**Important:** You cannot run `git clone` yourself because it will prompt for a password, which requires interactive input that Claude cannot handle. Instead, walk the user through running it themselves in a separate terminal window:

1. Tell the user to open a new terminal window (on Mac: open the Terminal app; on Windows: open PowerShell or Command Prompt)
2. Tell them to type `git clone` followed by the clone URL they copied in Step 2, then press Enter. (Give them an example of how the command will look, like `git clone https://...`)
3. Tell them the terminal will ask for a password — they should paste the password they copied in Step 2 and press Enter (the password won't be visible as they type).
4. Warn them that cloning can take several minutes — it's a large codebase. Tell them to sit tight and let you know when the download finishes. Don't assume it failed just because it's taking a while.
5. Ask the user to let you know once the clone is complete, then continue from here.

After cloning, cd into the repo:

```bash
cd BTNet
```

## Step 4: Authenticate to the private package feed and install dependencies

The project uses private npm packages that require authentication. Run:

```bash
pnpm run setup-project
```

This will:
1. Try to authenticate with the Buildertrend private package feed (a browser window may open — tell the user to sign in if prompted)
2. Install all project dependencies

**If this fails (especially on Mac)**, try the cross-platform alternative:

```bash
pnpm run setup-btfeedauth-crossplatform && pnpm install
```

**If both fail**, tell the user to reach out to **Michael Hanson** for help with package feed authentication before continuing.

After a successful install, confirm there are no errors in the output before moving on.

## Step 5: Configure the environment

Create the file `Clients.App/.env.development.local` with this content:

```
VITE_WARN_FLAGS=true
VITE_APIX_PROXY=https://api.test.buildertrend.net
VITE_WEBFORMS_URL=https://test.buildertrend.net
```

This tells the frontend to connect to the shared test environment instead of looking for a local backend server.

## Step 6: Start the dev server

First, change into the Clients.App directory:

```bash
cd Clients.App
```

**On Mac**, the dev server binds to port 443 which requires elevated permissions, so it must be run with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo pnpm run start
```

Tell the user they will be prompted for their Mac login password — they should type it and press Enter (the password won't be visible as they type).

**On Windows:**

```bash
pnpm run start
```

If you are unable to run the dev server (e.g., permission issues, the command hangs, or it gets blocked), walk the user through doing it manually instead:

1. Open a new terminal window
2. Navigate to the Clients.App folder inside the BTNet repo (e.g., `cd path/to/BTNet/Clients.App` — give them the actual path based on where they cloned it)
3. On Mac: run `sudo pnpm run start` and enter their Mac login password when prompted
4. On Windows: run `pnpm run start`
5. Wait for the terminal to show that the server is ready

Once the dev server is running (whether you started it or they did manually), tell the user to open their browser and go to https://local.buildertrend.net:443/

Confirm with the user that they can see the Buildertrend UI in their browser.

## Troubleshooting

If something goes wrong, here are common issues:

- **"Out of memory" or crashes during install/start**: The project needs ~16GB RAM. If their machine has less, this may be a problem. There's no easy fix — they may need a more powerful machine.
- **"Cannot find module" or "ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND"**: Dependencies didn't install properly. Run `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install` from the BTNet root directory.
- **"Unauthorized" or "401" during pnpm install**: The package feed authentication expired or failed. Re-run `pnpm run setup-bt-feed-credentials` or `pnpm run setup-btfeedauth-crossplatform`.
- **Node version errors**: Make sure they're on Node 22.x with `node --version`. Use `fnm use 22` to switch.
- **Git credential issues**: If the clone fails with auth errors, double-check they're using the correct username/password from ADO. They can re-generate credentials.
- **"EACCES" permission errors on Mac**: May need to fix npm global permissions. First run `whoami` and `npm config get prefix` to get the username and npm prefix path, then run `sudo chown -R <username> <prefix>/{lib/node_modules,bin,share}` with those literal values filled in.
- **Browser shows blank page or errors**: Check the terminal for error output. The dev server may still be starting up — wait for the "ready" message before opening the browser.
- **Login/authentication issues (Auth0)**: The user must sign in with their **@buildertrend.com** email address. If their Buildertrend account uses a different email, they'll need to update it first: go to https://buildertrend.net, sign in, navigate to **Security & Login -> Edit Username**, and change it to their @buildertrend.com email.

If you can't resolve an issue using the steps above, tell the user to reach out to **Michael Hanson** for help.
